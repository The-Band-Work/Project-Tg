# TGBG
TG Bug Group

## Status

Gathering data. We are at the name right now and need to get the name to encompass human unsiloing of research related to TGbug.

### Testing for Toxoplasmosis

- The current best way to test for TGBug is 
  - https://labtestsonline.org/tests/toxoplasmosis-testing
  - In USA, not well understood by most Dr.  Common test by vets. Anybody exposed to oocysts from cat poop is susceptible.  See a few vaccine journal articles  on GitHub
  - Disease: Toxoplasmosis
  - Parasite: T gondii
  - Blood test: IgM, IgG
  - Common tests are for  IgG, IgM antibodies for tachyzoite stage. Also  testing for bradyzoite (dormant) stage requires tissue biopsy, spinal fluid or more experimental molecular testing looking for bradyzoite metabolism. Univ Chicago, Univ Mich

- Francis
  - neural boundary is called NEURAL BINDING.
    - where electricity meets chemistry
- NEXT
  - steve is done with the data gathering side
  - jon is stuck on the name for the group, immediate name is ProjectTG
  - carl and francis are doing research
  - francis is sending jon info on the project cascade softare from NYT
- Summary
  - ProjectTG is unsiloing research (basic and applied) in order to first stop inflammation related to TGbug and later regenerate the human body from the damage done.
  - After having a name from our project, then the effort will be:
    - make a software stack from website outward, including a CRM
    - the data gathered will be used for marketing purposes and to make matrix chart to prioritize research
    - the goal is to get funding/resources and establish an investment fund more immediately and invest in the research to solve the current problem
    - should focus first on the TG bug and stopping the inflammation.
    - need to think through the campaign and the human side of the bug, tg, etc
    - The disease casued by TG bug is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasmosis
