# TGBG
TG Bug Group

## Status

Gathering data. We are at the name right now and need to get the name to encompass human unsiloing of research related to TGbug.

## Research Update 2021-12-09

Attaching a few articles on T gondii testing and others for understanding.  Recommend starting with "Life cycle" article.  Danger to humans are unborn child infected thru mother, also children and adults who are infected from uncooked meat or inhaling oocyst.  T gondii travel thru the body and can go dormant in muscles, heart, brain.  Note-life cycle article has links for downloading images at end.

The life-cycle of T gondii: oocyst ---> tachyzoite (infectious stage) ---> bradyzoite (dormant stage) ----> tachyzoite

You'll notice it is a huge world-wide problem.  Common route for human infection is under cooked meat.  Not typically tested for in USA.  Felines are the only host, parasites can infect any animal, primarily mammals.  The US does not have much going on other than Univ of Chicago med school.  However field evidence from other countries would imply the US (feral) cat population are carriers.  Research for vaccines is primarily in Europe and NZ.  A veterinary vaccine is available for sheep to prevent ewes aborting lambs.

### Testing for Toxoplasmosis

- The current best way to test for TGBug is 
  - https://labtestsonline.org/tests/toxoplasmosis-testing
  - In USA, not well understood by most Dr.  Common test by vets. Anybody exposed to oocysts from cat poop is susceptible.  See a few vaccine journal articles  on GitHub
  - Disease: Toxoplasmosis
  - Parasite: T gondii
  - Blood test: IgM, IgG
  - Common tests are for  IgG, IgM antibodies for tachyzoite stage. Also  testing for bradyzoite (dormant) stage requires tissue biopsy, spinal fluid or more experimental molecular testing looking for bradyzoite metabolism. Univ Chicago, Univ Mich

## Meetings 

### 2021-07-07 Meeting

- Where are we at?
  - Jon summarized: we are at the name right now and need to get the name to encompass human unsiloing of research related to TGbug.
- Name?
  - Biohub 
  - Neurohub
  - INFLAMMATION
  - Painhub
  - Carl: we cannot use the name TEAM, it is also used in politics
  - CARL: Need to rename
    - TeamTG > ProjectTG
    - TeamAI > ProjectAI
- Business models
    - In progress
- Product development lifecycle 
    - Need to understand these terms
      - Technology Readiness Level (TRL)
      - Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL)
    - Team leader
    - Product leader
    - DoD branch
    - Based on testing, prototypes
    - Carl: these stretch out many years
- Francis
  - neural boundary is called NEURAL BINDING.
    - where electricity meets chemistry
- NEXT
  - steve is done with the data gathering side
  - jon is stuck on the name for the group, immediate name is ProjectTG
  - carl and francis are doing research
  - francis is sending jon info on the project cascade softare from NYT
- Summary
  - ProjectTG is unsiloing research (basic and applied) in order to first stop inflammation related to TGbug and later regenerate the human body from the damage done.
  - After having a name from our project, then the effort will be:
    - make a software stack from website outward, including a CRM
    - the data gathered will be used for marketing purposes and to make matrix chart to prioritize research
    - the goal is to get funding/resources and establish an investment fund more immediately and invest in the research to solve the current problem
    - should focus first on the TG bug and stopping the inflammation.
    - need to think through the campaign and the human side of the bug, tg, etc
    - The disease casued by TG bug is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasmosis


### 2021-06-22 2nd Meeting

- Blue cube, NRO, national research , remnants at Lockheed
- Get money
- Jonathan silversteinâ€¦has PD
    - Investment firm and
- Another guy in Texas has PD
- Canva.com
- Steve will use powerpoint to create slides
- Steve saving our contacts into a spreadsheet will checkin here so we can grow our strategy

### 2021-06-16 1st Meeting

- Attending: Francis, Carl, Steve, Jon
- Figured out working plan and what is goal
- Goal is to get the parasite out of the host
- Needs resources to continue
- Steve to get with Francis and distill info for Carl, Jon
- Agreed on need for higher bandwidth weekly call
- and we are here :)
